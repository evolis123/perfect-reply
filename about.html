        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p><strong>Our Mission:</strong> To empower professionals worldwide to communicate with confidence.</p>
        <p>We are Ceyhun and Tora, a team passionate about breaking down language barriers. As a non-native English speaker, Ceyhun often felt the pressure and self-doubt that comes with writing crucial business emails. "Does this sound professional? Is my grammar correct? Am I conveying the right tone?" - these questions were a constant source of stress and wasted time.</p>
        <p>We realized millions of talented professionals around the world face the same challenge. Your great ideas shouldn't be limited by your language skills.</p>
        <p>That's why we created <strong>ProLingo</strong>. It's not just a grammar checker; it's a confidence booster. It's a simple, fast, and focused tool designed to do one thing perfectly: help you craft professional, natural-sounding email replies in seconds, so you can focus on what you do best.</p>
